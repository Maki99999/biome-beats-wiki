# Categories of Conditions

Conditions are grouped into four categories, accessible via the tabs on the left. Use the search field to locate specific conditions within each category.

## Biome Conditions

There is a biome condition for each biome, triggered when the player stays in that biome for at least three seconds. This includes modded biomes.

## Biome Tag Conditions

(Sub-)Biomes have tags that describe attributes like "cold," "dry," "snowy," or "overworld." These are useful for setting up tracks across dimensions or similar biomes. Biome tags from other mods are included.

## Other Conditions

Most conditions in this category reflect Minecraft’s internal mechanics, plus a few additional ones for convenience. The “No Other Music Is Playing” condition is a fallback that’s always met (with the lowest priority) and can be used to have background music when no other condition is active.

## Combined Conditions

Useful for specific situations, these conditions activate only when all their sub-conditions are met. For example:
- The player is on a cold hill at night (conditions "Is Cold," "Is Hill," "Is Night").
- The player is in the nether and in creative mode (conditions "Is Nether," "In Creative Mode").
- The player is under water in a cave (conditions "Is Cave", "Is Under Water").
