# Configuration

Configuration is managed in-game through the config menu. When in a world, press the "Open Config" key (default is "B") to access the configuration screen. The configuration auto-saves after exiting the screen.

The main screen is split into two parts. On the left, you can browse and select conditions by category using the tabs. When you select a condition, the right side displays its settings, where you can assign music tracks and more.

At the bottom left, there are two buttons:
- The "Reload" button reloads the config file and re-detects biomes and biome tags.
- The "Open Music Folder" button opens the folder where you can add music files. After adding files, press reload to make them appear in the config screen.
