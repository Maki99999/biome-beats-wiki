# Adding and Editing a Combined Condition

![Config Screen with Combined Conditions](/img/combined1.jpg)

The combined conditions tab includes an additional button to add a new condition, and each existing combined condition has an edit button beside it. Beyond this, configuring priorities and assigning music tracks works the same as it does for standard conditions.

When creating or editing a combined condition, a new screen will appear where you can customize its details. You can:
- Set a name for the condition.
- Add a short description.
- Select the sub-conditions that must all be met for the combined condition to activate.
