# Configuring a Condition

![Config Screen with a condition selected](/img/main3.jpg)

When you select a condition, you can configure its priority level and assign music tracks to play whenever the condition is met.

## Priority

The priority determines which conditions take precedence when multiple are active. Higher priority numbers mean greater importance. If a condition with a higher priority is met, conditions with lower priorities are ignored. For more details, refer to [this section](../how-the-mod-chooses-a-music-track).

## Music Tracks

You can assign any number of music tracks to a condition. When the condition is met, one of these tracks is chosen randomly. Tracks are organized with custom songs at the top, followed by Minecraftâ€™s background music and music discs, and finally tracks from other mods.

Use the search field to locate specific songs. Click the button next to a track to preview it.
