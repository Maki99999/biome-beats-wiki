# Upcoming Features

I still have some ideas I want to implement in the future.

- Structure Conditions: Like biome conditions but with structures like the stronghold.
- Individual Track Volume Control: This would allow you to adjust the volume of each track separately, which is helpful if your custom tracks have different audio levels.
- UI Improvements: Small tweaks, like an indicator to show which conditions have music assigned and which ones are currently active.
- Backports for Earlier Minecraft Versions: Backporting the mod to older versions is a bit tricky with the multiloader setup I have, but doing it modloader by modloader and version by version should be manageable, just time-consuming.
- Additional Settings:
  - Bringing back random silences between songs, for those who like the pauses in vanilla Minecraft.
  - Adjusting fade-in and fade-out times between the tracks.
- "Winamp": A mini-player you can have in a corner of the screen (or somewhere else) where you can see the current song, its duration etc. It could also have controls to e.g. pause or skip songs.
- Condition Grouping: A way to group conditions, so you can assign music to all of them at once, rather than setting each condition manually.
- Support for More Audio Formats: Iâ€™m looking into a Java library that could make it possible to play nearly any audio format, though switching to it would require some extra work.
