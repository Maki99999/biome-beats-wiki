# Control When a Track Should Play

You decide when specific songs play. For example, you could set underwater music to play outside ocean biomes or bring in spooky tracks at night. This lets you fine-tune the gameâ€™s atmosphere to match your desired vibe.

The mod uses conditions to determine when specific music tracks should play. A condition could be something like:
- "The player is in the plains biome."
- "The player is in a 'cold' biome."
- "The player is underwater."
- "A boss health bar is visible."

For each condition, you can select the tracks that will play whenever the condition is met.

You can combine conditions by selecting multiple individual ones. A combined condition is fulfilled only when all its parts are met, giving you more control over when certain tracks play and letting you fine-tune the music to match specific situations. For example, you could set up a combined condition that triggers when the player is in a cold forest at night.
